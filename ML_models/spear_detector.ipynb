for the mistakes you might find below : - ) . i hope that you will not mind if some of my explanations are in french . for my ph . d . semiotics , i am writing a dissertation on discourse and science-fiction and i need some information about the construction of neologisms in french and in english . ( neologisms are useful in sf , specially in the scientific field ! ) in french , neologisms are made in 5 different ways ( i hope these are the right english words ) : derivation ; composition ; imitation ; pure invention ; amalgam . one might also add borrowings from other languages . here are some examples ( sorry , the explanations are in french ) : - derivation : mot derive : \" position \" peut produire le verbe \" positionner \" ; - composition : mot compose : si \" monotone \" est decompose ( \" mono \" / \" tone \" ) , on peut recomposer \" polytone \" ; a partir de \" telephone \" on peut produire en science-fiction \" videophone \" . - imitation : souvent a partir d \\' une onomatopee : a partir de l \\' onomatopee \" couac \" on peut parler d \\' un \" couac \" ( = un nom ) ; - invention : mot forge : se distingue des autres categories car on ne reconnait dans la morphologie du mot aucun terme existant ( ex . : \" emparouille \" , \" endosque \" , \" pratele \" , \" libucque \" , \" ecorbalise \" - extraits d \\' henri michaux ) . cette categorie est contestee car certains pretendent qu \\' il est toujours possible de retrouver la racine . - amalgam : mot - valise : reunion de deux mots sur la base d \\' une homonymie partielle ; ainsi \" famille \" et \" millionnaire \" peuvent donner \" famillionnaire \" . in the every day french language , the 3 first ( mostly the 2 first ) processes are more frequent and the 2 others are used in the literary ( and humoristic ) discourse . my question ( s ) is ( are ) about the construction of neologisms in english . 1 ) does english use the same processes ? 2 ) even if it does , are the processes of the same importance in both languages ? 3 ) what would be the most frequent ones ? 4 ) what are the major differences ? 5 ) etc . thank you in advance , sylvie berard -
